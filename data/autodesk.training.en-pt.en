If you get an "Unable to initialize adlm" error after uninstalling a Service Pack, please read the following knowledge base article: Unable to initialize adlm error after uninstalling a Service Pack for 2015 products. 
 If you have Alias Automotive 2015 with SP1 installed, and you attempt to install Alias Surface 2015, you are blocked from installing at the configuration page with a message that newer version of that product already exists.
If you have two levels with the same elevation, Revit will perform better if all rooms are placed on one of the two levels, rather than dividing the same rooms between the two levels.
If you need to be where an internet connection is not available, sync your files in advance.
If your drawings are stored on a file storage service such as DropBox, or any service that supports WebDAV, you can easily connect it to AutoCAD 360 and work on your files directly.
 If you render interactively in a viewport, you can save the image at different stages of the iterative render process.
If you select an object and then orbit the view, the selected object is used as the center of rotation. 
If you would like to open your drawings while offline, AutoCAD 360 mobile app allows you to that.

Note:Depending on your model stiffness, certain external load increases could result in your model operating outside the material and geometric linear elasticity region. 
NOTE  For iOS5 users, the duplicate is saved in the same location as the original sketch.
NOTE  For iOS5 users, this variation is saved in the same location as the original sketch. 
Note:For large or complex assemblies, investigate the various components and assess their roles in the design simulation. 
Note:For modal analysis, where no or only partial constraints are used, rigid body modes are calculated which have zero or near zero (numerical noise) frequencies.
Note:For more details, refer to standard mechanical engineering design books such as the one by J.E. Shigley et. 
Note:If applicable, look to simplify complex loads through a combination of different basic loads. 
Note:If you are dealing with high impact loads or wish to examine the transient response or frequency response spectra, look to Autodesk Simulation Mechanical/Multiphysics (Algor). 
Note:If you have not reviewed the deformation animation, do so and make sure that the behavior is as expected.
Note:In assemblies, where many disconnected bodies or subassemblies are possible, each connected set of bodies could have six rigid body modes. 
Note:In the case of an elastic layer, you input the equivalent spring value to approximate the layer stiffness. 
Note:Point loads and constraints can also cause localized stress singularities.
Note:Refines the mesh across the whole model.
Note:Resonant frequencies are proportional to the square root of stiffness divided by mass. 
Note:Separation still assumes that each body is in the linear elastic zone, so both material and geometric linearities (small deformation) are valid.
Note:Since the frequency analysis captures global behavior of the model, mesh refinements are done across the entire model.
Note:The displacement field is not unique since they can be augmented by any combination of the three rigid body modes.
Note:The mesh is automatically refined, for the specific result type, in the areas of interest. 
Note:The modal frequency analysis assumes that the model is following linear elastic behavior. 
Note:The rigid motion of hanging parts can be restrained through a combination of boundary constraints, contact conditions, and/or balanced loads. 
Note:This step is primarily for assembly analysis.
Note:To obtain a finer mesh in the areas of interest, you can use local mesh control, along with adaptive convergence, to yield better results.
Note:Typically, a numerical accuracy of 10% or better is sufficient in most practical design cases.
Note:When you exclude a component from your simulation, use a remote force to simulate the impact of the components weight on the model. 
Note:You can also access specific Guide topics through browser context menus. 
Note:You can restrain rigid motion of hanging parts using a combination of boundary constraints, contact conditions, and/or balanced loads arising from Dynamic Simulation-based inertia/reaction forces. 
Note:You can use this constraint to emulate symmetry conditions.

When an analysis does not complete successfully Drainage Design displays a message. 
When an element is changed in one view the change is instantly visible in the other views of the model. 
When an element is selected, instance properties display on the Properties palette. 
When a project has been edited by other users for a day or more, it may be faster to create a new local from the central model rather than relying on “Reload latest” to update the individual local model a day or more behind the remainder of the team.
When attempts to “Synch with Central” collide, Revit displays a dialog notifying that another user is currently saving to central. 
When both backface culling and GPU instancing is on, negative-scaled objects may show inconsistent culling result in VP2. 
When connecting to a 2012 Autodesk Data Management Server using SSL and a server signed certificate, Vault Explorer may become unresponsive.
When creating detail views, model hatches with filled regions not lines.
When depth peeling is chosen as the transparency algorithm for Viewport 2.0 (in Hardware 2.0 Renderer 2.0 Settings window), MSAA can only take effect on opaque objects but not transparent objects.
When downloading a file using the web client, double byte characters are not handled properly resulting in unreadable characters.
When ‘Enforce Unique File Names’ is enabled, attempting to copy and paste a non-CAD files results in an ‘Object reference not set to an instance of an object’ message.
Whenever you want to work on your drawing back in AutoCAD, you can easily download the drawing back to your computer using AutoCAD 360 web app. 
When General Preferences > Save Workspace On Exit is selected, Alias does not save the position and size of the main Alias Window. 
When General Preferences > Viewing > View Control is set to View Panel, and you press ALT-SHIFT, the panel appears. 
When importing a Preference Set (.aps) file from Alias 2013 to 2015, shelves, marking menus, and Hotkeys are not imported. 
When logged in with Windows authentication clicking on a file link occasionally resulted in the error, "An unexpected error has occurred".
When logged in with Windows authentication clicking on a file link occasionally resulted in the error, "An unexpected error has occurred".
When making significant changes in a project (moving a level or major geometry changes), it is recommended that you perform the operation when no other users are working on the file and they have relinquished all elements, then have all users make new local files.
When multiple security settings are enabled on a folder, the settings would incorrectly prevent a user from performing a state change on a file.
When performing an Item Update on an AutoCAD Electrical project Item produced using copy design, the BOM quantities may all change to the value 1.
When performing an Item Update on an AutoCAD Electrical project Item, the BOM quantities may all change to the value 1.
When running the scene view in overlay render mode, you may not be able to override your renderer.
When saving Stage Sets, any stages that were not retrieved and have not been saved yet will have incorrect references in the saved stage set. 
When selecting a different copy design folder, the error “the given key was not present in the dictionary” was thrown and a user could not continue.
When the cursor displays as an arrow, the Modify tool is active, and you can select model elements. 
When the Double Sided Lighting option under the DirectX 11 Shader Attribute Editor is enabled, backfacing polygons caused by negative scaling may turn black.
when the level is moved, the tops and bottoms of the walls are moved as well.
When the magnifying or SDB window is active, trying to print causes a crash because these windows do not have cameras. 
When trying to update a file's properties using the IExplorerUtil's object during a custom job handler, the first job that is run would succeed but all subsequent jobs would fail until the Job Processor was restarted.
When using a custom numbering scheme using Free text, Vault export may fail with the message "An error occurred when applying configuration".
When using a custom numbering scheme using a Pre-defined list, Vault export may fail with the message "An error occurred when applying configuration".
When using Google Chrome to access the Web Client, File and Item grids are not displayed.
When working in a view, use the middle mouse button to perform navigation tasks. 
When you access AutoCAD 360 through your PC or your Mac’s web browser you can add folders and to move, rename or delete files. 
When you add detail elements to model geometry to enhance or clarify the view, they are visible only in the view in which you placed them.
When you change the name of a level, the corresponding views in the project are changed as well.  
When you change the position of a wall using the temporary dimensions, the roof will respond to the change.
When you change the roof geometry or position, the walls will respond to the change.
When you create a system, you create a logical relationship between related elements in a project. 
When you place a model family into a project, the family displays in all views of the model. 
When you place a table component in the Furniture Plan view, it is also visible in the Floor Plan view.  
When you place the cursor over an element, the element is highlighted. 
When you place walls in the entry level plan, the bases of the walls are constrained to the entry level datum.
When you select an analytical element, instance properties display on the properties palette. 
When you select a tool that requires you to sketch a boundary, such as the Floor tool, sketch mode is automatically enabled. 
Where can I learn more about Material and Appearance libraries and the associated definitions? 
Where possible, avoid arrays and formulas.
Where possible, avoid widespread use of voids in family geometry.
Where the path to the MSI from the DVD or download root directory is: /x64(or x86)/Alias/Alias20.0.msi
Whether you select an element at a time or use a window to select a group of elements, 
which ensures that the roof you place will be constrained to the roof level in the project.
While the capability to check out a workset remains valuable under certain circumstances outlined below, in general the best practice is to use element borrowing rather than checking out entire worksets.

Because ProdName stores all objects in drawings, the drawing does not have to be associated with a project. 
Because a notebook is configured to preserve battery life, the Power Options may need to be adjusted to take full advantage of processor speed. 
Because AutoCAD 360 is a web application, all the different versions are automatically saved on the AutoCAD 360 server, so there is no need to waste time by manually creating backups and copies.
Because Autodesk AutoCAD Civil 3D is built on Autodesk AutoCAD and Autodesk AutoCAD Map 3D, it is recommended that you also review the AutoCAD and AutoCAD Map 3D readme files at the following locations. 
Because Autodesk Revit LT software is fully compatible with Autodesk® Revit®, Autodesk® Revit® Architecture, Autodesk® Revit® MEP, and Autodesk® Revit® Structure software, you can exchange files with any firm on the Revit platform.
Because Connect explicitly defines the component location and degrees of freedom, fewer connections are required to provide consistent and predictable results. 
Because design checks return either a true or false value, they must contain one of the following logical operators: > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equals), <= (less than or equals), !

Because of this issue, you cannot send WebDAV requests to a server that does not reside in the same domain as the .js file.
Because the imported model uses real-world content libraries and associated data, you can more quickly optimize your takeoff and submit a competitive bid.
Because the installed Inventor library content varies by geography, this tutorial does NOT include an exercise which shows how to Place a component from the Content Center or the Bolted Connection command. 
Because the lines stop where driveways cross the sidewalk, the conditional subassembly adds and removes the sidewalk depending on the presence of the sidewalk line. 
Because the performance of connected networks decreases with larger size, the benefits of data propagation and connectivity may be outweighed by the need for better model manipulation performance.
Because there are multiple closed shapes, Inventor selects none of them. 
Because there are two closed shapes, Inventor requires that you specify the Profile to use. 
Because there are two ways the tools work, some users have difficulty creating single line segments while others have difficulty creating multi-segment polylines.
Because there is only one closed shape in the sketch, the profile is automatically selected.
Because the UCS icon lets you directly manipulate the UCS, you can align it with objects more easily—without having to access the UCS command.
Because this command deletes and recreates the corridors in the intersection, if you made any changes to the corridors in the intersection object, those changes will be overwritten when the new corridors are created.
Because this file is an assembly, the command is not present.
Because volume computations may affect the performance of your Revit project, they are disabled by default, except Revit MEP where the setting is enabled. 
because you experience a drop in performance, which is significant, when you enable this system variable in comparison to the reduction in memory usage, which is not that significant.
Because you selected a catalog to import, Quantification now gives you the opportunity to specify the exact catalog content to import.
Become familiar with the information available on the  and IT Managers' resource.
Be compliant with manufacturer content libraries. 
Before a cloud can be saved with a viewpoint, it needs to be terminated correctly. 
Before adding surface data to a drawing, ensure that the styles and settings are set up. 
Before creating or importing points, specify the settings that control how the points are numbered and how point number collisions are handled.
Before editing an existing sample line style to change its properties, remember that any changes you make will apply to all sample lines that use the style. 
Before enabling the 3 GB feature, see 3 GB Feature Considerations. 
Before generating your BOM, set your asset files to either writeable or read only. 
Before importing a license, ensure that the related Autodesk product or suite is already installed on the computer that is importing the license.
Before importing Land Desktop pipe run data, make sure that the ProdName pipe network Parts Catalog (Parts List) has the part sizes that make sense for the pipe network you will be importing. 
Before importing layered files into SketchBook Pro, it’s important you read this section. 
Before including a service pack with a deployment, the Microsoft Installer Patch (MSP) file must be extracted from the downloaded service pack executable file.

Before opening an IFC file, use the Import IFC Options dialog to specify Revit categories and subcategories for each IFC class. 
Before opening an IFC file, use the Import IFC Options dialog to specify the default template.
Before opening an IFC file, you can specify the template to use, load a file that maps IFC classes to Revit categories, and manually override Revit categories for IFC classes.
Before printing or exporting the model, you may want to reload the specified resources to make sure you have up to date information.
Before projecting an object into a view, ensure that the elevation of the object has been specified. 
Before publishing a DWF(x) file, the architect, engineer, or other designer, determines which features (model, layouts, layers, properties and so on) to include in the DWF(x) file. 
Before publishing the scenario, click Home tabDesign panelDesign Feed.
Before running a workflow, ensure that the design contains only the required objects, and any layers not required are turned off or frozen.

Issue:  A warning dialog will show during the import: “Some ACIS objects could not be imported. 
Issue:  Binding an IFC Link creates elements in the project that cannot host elements or be edited, cut, joined, added to an assembly or turned into parts. 
Issue:  Elements in a linked IFC file cannot be used for functions that require dimensions, snapping, or align.
Issue:  In rare cases when an IFC link is reloaded the linked model does not appear to change, or if Reload From is used, the geometry from both may be displayed.
Issue:  Legacy issue, Revit shutting down process in progress while Raytacing on separate thread is still running.
Issue:  Preview image is not correctly being generated and saved within the part family.
Issue:  Revit attempts to use multi-threading to process images within a view. 
Issue: Revit may appear to hang during save or Save With Central if the workstation’s rsn.ini file lists servers that do not exist, though the operation will eventually succeed given enough time.
Issue:  Revit will scale the image by aspect ratio by default, so when you adjust the image column width, the image height will also be changed and thus the image row height will also be changed.
Issue:  The associated images can only be shown in the schedule graphics in a sheet view, they cannot be shown in any other view.
Issue: The only known cause that could result in such constant failure is that the server doesn’t have “Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable (x64)” installed, which is required by the functionality of extracting model thumbnails. 
Issue:  When you added images in the Manage Images dialog to project, Revit will import the images rather than link them.
