Therefore, most subassemblies typically contain a relatively simple code list. 
Therefore, north is always considered to point along the WCS positive Y axis, and inquiry results are reported in WCS coordinates.
Therefore, the entity geometry moves with the entity to which it is attached.
Therefore, the total rigid body modes for an assembly could be far more than six.
Therefore, this attachment point is more of layout time assistance rather than design point control.
Therefore, though you may see regions created on other layers, if you are on an empty layer, paint will completely flood the empty layer and ignore any pixels on other layers.
Therefore, when the structure’s insertion location is outside the profile view, the structure does not display in the profile view.
Therefore, you cannot obtain valid deformation and stress fields using static analysis. 
Therefore, you must import an imperial-based project into an imperial-based drawing, for example. 
The regression data can be modified, and then applied to the entity. 
The regression data can be modified either before or after the entity has been created.

This rule allows you to set the start and end locations of the pipes to be at the structure center or at an offset relative to the structure's inner or outer wall.
This rule ensures that a pipe slopes appropriately and warns when a pipe is placed too close to a ground surface.
This rule ensures that the minimum cover is met along the length of the pipe, and also validates that both the minimum and maximum cover values are not violated along any length of the pipe.
This rule governs how a pipe elevation is determined in a pipe network that contains only pipes (no structures), and or when a pipe is inserted onto an existing pipe to break the pipe.
This rule governs the behavior that produces a warning condition on a pipe if the pipe length exceeds the value specified for the maximum pipe length, or is less than the value specified for the minimum pipe length.
This rule is intended for laying out pipes in a pressure-based pipe network where pipe elevations are determined according to a specified depth below a terrain.

Typical interface for data download
Typically, in a stable, well-constrained model, refining the mesh stabilizes your stress values. 
Typically, maximum displacements tend to converge more quickly than maximum stresses. 
Typically, the optimal resolution for on-screen viewing is not optimal for plotting. 
Typically, there is no need to represent pipe networks as both projected and crossings in the same profile.
Typically the resulting volume is not exactly what was entered as the target value. 
(typically uses the same formula as NCtoLC)
Typically you assign read-write access at the project level, and then apply restrictions to sub-folders within a project. 
Typically, you insert a geographic marker by specifying its geographic location on a map and picking the corresponding point in model space.

while the alignment is edited.
While the box has three rigid body modes, the rollers balance the vertical force resulting in a valid stress field. 
While the SAVEAS command can be used to save a drawing from one format to another, it is not efficient when exchanging multiple drawings that need to be saved to a different format. 
While these command line options are active, you can also enter P for Point cloud and select an entire point cloud.
While the utilization of the Local and Roaming user folders might work well in single-seat or small office environment, it is recommended to place all customization files in a centralized network location. 
While updates are downloading, you can pause, resume, or cancel your request.
While VBA is a suitable environment for fast prototyping and simple end-user macros, use the Inventor add-in mechanism for professional application development using C++, C# or VB.NET.
While working on any canvas, user can see link file’s content in host file when the link file is from vault.
While you cannot rotate the origin point, it will rotate with the host if the host is rotated.
While you have the intersection selected, you can enable the Curb Return options on the Intersections panel by single-clicking any of the manipulators around the highlighted intersection. 
While you select parcels, the dialog box remains open.
